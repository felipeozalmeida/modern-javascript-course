# Modern Javascript Course

Hello!

This is a collection of small projects that I've been doing, based on what I know and what I've learned while watching the Modern Javascript Course by Brad Traversy on Udemy (please check it out!).

Almost all of them tries to explore one specific concept of Javascript, be it objects, prototypal inheritance, classes or old school DOM manipulation.

Feel free to explore!
